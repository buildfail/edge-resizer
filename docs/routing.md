# ðŸ”Œ Routing Strategy

Edge Resizer will try to infer the source image's URL by taking into account, in the first place, an optional route prefix (see [deploy](deploy.html)),  then a regular expression matching the pattern of [available transformations](transformations.html). When both are present, **make sure the prefix comes before  the transformation part** :

| *worker subdomain* |*prefix or transformation*| *origin hostname*| *origin pathname*|
|----------|------|---------|  --- |
|`zone/` |`img/w=300_h=200` | `/riff.one` | `/images/designcue-unsplash.jpg`|
|`zone/` |`img` | `/riff.one` | `/images/designcue-unsplash.jpg`|
|`zone/` |`w=300_h=200` | `/riff.one` | `/images/designcue-unsplash.jpg`|
|`zone/` |`w=300_h=200/img` | `/riff.one` |  <span style="color:red"><span style="margin:-0.5em 1em -0.2em 0 ;font-size:2em;padding:0;float:left">:cry:</span> won't work</span> |

The last URL wouldn't work. The prefix must come before the transformation part. Otherwise it would be **postfix**.

If neither is found, Edge Resizer will ultimately forward the request. If this is unintended, you can ensure the URL is treated as an image by passing an underscore as dummy prefix:

| *worker subdomain* |*prefix or transformation*| *origin hostname*| *origin pathname*|
|----------|------|---------|  --- |
|`https://img.ctohm.com/` |`_` | `/riff.one` | `/images/designcue-unsplash.jpg`|



## Transformation vs searchParams

When present, the transformation part is turned into searchParams as expected by  [img.weserv.nl](https://img.weserv.nl). You can pass said searchParams directly and they'll be forwarded accordingly.

</div>

This is the only way in which some transformations detailed on [images.weserv.nl docs](https://images.weserv.nl/docs/), which we don't explicitly consider, can be applied to your images.

You might wonder: "*why not just use the searchParams and forget about routing?*". Well: There was  **[:boom: a very practical reason](use_cases.html)** to implement our routing logic. But having compact and tidy URLs is nice too.
